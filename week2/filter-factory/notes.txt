Factories / Services

	- Objects that can be used in multiple places
		- Can be used to share information between controllers

	- Lazily instantiated - Only created when your application is actually USING it

	- Singletons - Only ever instantiated ONCE

	- $timeout, $http, $log, $filter - Built in services in Angular often start with a '$'


Filters

	- Used to format expression values in Angular
	- Normally used inside of directives in your HTML
		-CAN be used in your controllers (injectable)
	- Make your own custom filters
	- Good built in filters - orderBy, date, filter, currency
