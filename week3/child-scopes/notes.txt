$scope

var outside = 'wassup'

function exterior(){
	// access to both OUTSIDE and INSIDE
	var inside = 'hello'

	function interior(){

console.log(inside) // it no work


Child Scopes

	- Child scopes typically inherit from their parent scope
		- Exceptions are : directives that create an ISOLATE scope
						   directives that have a TRANSCLUDED scope
						   	  Transcluded scopes are SIBLING scopes

	- Some directives create child scopes
		- ngRepeat (Copies properties from parent scope onto itself)
		- ngView
		- ngInclude
		- ngSwitch
		- Custom directives (if given the option)

	- Other things that create Parent-Child scope relationships
		- Nested ngControllers


When working with ngModels - a good rule of thumb is to always have a '.' in your model
