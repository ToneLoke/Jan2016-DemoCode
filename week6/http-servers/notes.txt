when you type http://google.com into the browser's url bar, what is actually happening?

First, we need google's IP address.  We first contact the DNS (domain name system) server, saying we're looking for google.com. The DNS server tells us the IP address for google.com.

Then, we send an HTTP GET request to google's ip address at port 80. 
In response, google sends back a response with response HEADERS, that describe the response (was it successful? etc) and a response BODY, that contains the information we asked for.
