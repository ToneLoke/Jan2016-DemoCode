What is node.js?

A javascript runtime environment.
The v8 engine transplanted into the commandline

How is node.js different from browser javascript?

    No window object - (no global object)
    No DOM
    module system
    file system access
    networking access - send and receive requests
    hardware access
    node.js makes for a great server


type `node` to access the node.js REPL: read, evaluate, print, loop.

process.argv (the arguments vector) contains all the arguments passed into the script. The first argument is node.js. The second argument is the script that is being called. The other arguments are passed in at the command line. You can use process.argv.slice(2) to skip the first two arguments.

Whatever VALUE is assigned to module.exports in one file can be REQUIREd in other files.

write a node script that copies a text file.
e.g. node copy.js source.txt destination.txt

asynchronous : multiple events happening simultaneously


3 places to require from:
local file e.g. require('./localFile')
core modules e.g. require('fs')

installed e.g. require('underscore')
    to install a module and save it to your package.json: npm install <module name> --save
